# Project 1: Shared shopping list

Write the documentation of your project here. Do not include your personal
details (e.g. name or student number).

Remember to include the address of the online location where your project is
running as it is a key part of the submission.
*****************

address for the online location is given in the README.md file.
The README.md outlines project specific that has:

    The name of the application
    A brief description of the application
    The location where the application has been deployed and where one can test it, if an online deployment exists.
    Guidelines for running the application locally (you can assume that participants have docker-compose).
